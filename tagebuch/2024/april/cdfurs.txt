WARNIGN (class blink)

Foxhunt against defcon furs will start soon ...

they will call themself "pedo-hunter" but in fact they are just normal hunter that hunt down witnesses for criminals from the ecconomy or the military

they call themselfs "Pedo-Hunter" as Tarnung, most people at least once opend eg pornhub or yourporn. the search function gives you what it thinks is what you are looking for, so chance is big, that the function also sent you to images from people that are only 21 or 18 that would comply with the law in europe.

calling oneself pedo-hunter makes a person already to something like a judge, and if you would like to kill a young fox on two legs, and is maybe a naive nerd, he or she would maybe not even realize that it is an attack against the sexual integrity of the young nerdy fox on two legs.

further if a 16 year old kid produces such content for same age kids, it's somehow not the right of older people to go after them. But in switzerland abot 2015 there was a case where a judge verurteilte a 16 year old girl, because she produced child-pornography for same age people. you will not find anything about this case anymore, it got all censored. in my opinion, law articles against child-porongraphy make sense to protect childern, but to sue them ??? WTF !!! But i BET, today the contents of the girl are still on the "evidence computer" of the specific judge in question.

I mean, they made suche images with me when i was about a 5 year old boy. in they age of 5 years this are NO BABY PHOTOS anymore. and my ... also does not look like an old ugly hanging truck-nut (image snowden && john olover) since the "musculus cremaster" in this age ???. from my perspective it would be completely ok if same age people or younger people would consume this content of my younger me. or if i would have a girl-friend that she would consume that content. anyway if you have a girl-friend she sould maybe have ???mitspracherecht??? so for me it is ok, but maybe not people from aarau or switzerland that i personally know in real life, this would give a lot of unconfortable situations. i bet that's the reason why you many of this sort of webpages have a selector where you can select "[x] dont show in your own country". but i would run suicide if people that are violent, offensife or weaponized would consume this content. Weapons do imply violence and that's exactly what i dont want to have in my bed.







anybody noticed where we started, it was about economic crimes and massmurderer by military people

Nerds or people that suffer from autism but are gifted in computer science often find out very fast if the company they work for does anything awful. Autistic people dont want to lie, autistic people hate to lie because they have often even physical pain if they would lie

but militaries and ecconomy needs people gifted in computer science
